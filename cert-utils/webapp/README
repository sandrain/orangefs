The purpose of this project is to provide a web interface that allows users
of an OrangeFS system to download certificates. The certificates are created
using the Globus Toolkit and provide access control for the user's files.


Requirements:
-------------
Apache2
PHP5
Perl
Globus Toolkit - http://www.globus.org/

Apache2 Requirements:
---------------------

Modules:
   mod_php5
   mod_ssl

Configuration:
   This directory must be able to execute php scripts and use htacces files.
   The cgi-bin directory must be able to execute cgi scripts.
   
   Example:
   
   <Directory /path/to/this/directory>
	    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	    AllowOverride All
	    
	    <FilesMatch "\.ph(p3?|tml)$">
	        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
	    </FilesMatch>
	    <FilesMatch "\.phps$">
	        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
	    </FilesMatch>
	</Directory>
	
	<Directory /path/to/this/directory/cgi-bin>
	    Options +ExecCGI
	</Directory>


Perl Requirements:
------------------

Packages:
	perl-suid
	
Modules:
	Data::Dumper
	IPC::Run
	CGI
	

Permissions:
------------

./cgi-bin/download.pl is a setuid script. This allows it to write files to
user's home directories and run the Globus scripts almost as if the user had
logged in through a terminal. The following command will set the correct
permissions for the script, but should be run as root or with sudo:

   chown root:apache ./cgi-bin/download.pl && chmod ug+xs,o-rwx ./cgi-bin/download.pl
   

Customization:
--------------

The download script can be edited as needed.

The web interface can be customized by creating or editing these 4 files:
    custom.css
    custom_header.php
    custom_content.php
    custom_footer.php

The custom* files will be included only if they exist and the php files will
be included instead of the related default_* php files.

Authentication can be setup any way you would like using ./.htaccess but the
user logged in, the REMOTE_USER, has to be a user on the same system this
is located.
