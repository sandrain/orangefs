2.9

  Ported all code to work with OrangeFS 2.9. Overhauled the build system
  so that modules can be built individually.

2.8.7

  added code to prevent seeing two slashes in file names under some
  circumstances.

  added code to enforce permissions on read and write.

  morphed DavPVFSInit server directive into PVFSInit, now both
  modules (and all modules in the future?) will use PVFSInit to 
  decide whether or not to run PVFS_util_init_defaults().
