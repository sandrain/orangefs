.SH CAVEATS
In a network of multiple clients, if the user database is not
sychronized between systems, these settings will have little meaning.
They will be enforced, which can cause problems if this is not wanted.
.PP
Note that because OrangeFS is a network file system, any user with
access to the network may be able to circumvent file permissions.
